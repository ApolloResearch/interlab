    "\n",
    "The helper class `CarSaleAction` is describing the output we want from the agent in this specific game. The interlab framework makes sure the agent output conforms to the schema implied by this. This is useful even for very simple cases like rock-paper-scissors (via a simple 3-value `Enum`) as it tells the model what input we accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the field descriptions are seen by the agent as well as field names and both can be very helpful to get the intended output from the agent, although description may not be needed for simple self-evident fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the class is a [Pydantic dataclass](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/dataclasses/) which is an extension of the standard python `dataclass` supporting [many more field types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/types/) and allowing for a more flexible and permissive parsing.\n",

    "In principle, one can implement a scenario as a simple for-loop iterating over the rounds of the game, directly querying the player agents. We will implement an `Environment` class instead as a demonstration, as it allows for better composability and structure, especially in more complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the round will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let active player *act* -- query them for `CarSaleAction`.\n",
    "2. Let the players *observe* what happened. For LLMs, you can just have them observe any text, for other cases (e.g. game theory or RL players) the observations can be anything JSON-like.\n",
    "3. Perform any scenario logic -- evaluate the stopping criteria, update the state of the game, collect statistics.\n"
